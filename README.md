# Time Since  App

Welcome to the **Time Since App**! This application allows users to track the time elapsed since a specific start date.  
I created this app as a way to gain more hands one experience with mobile app development as well as declarative UI/UX design.  
The app is meant to be as simple, elegant, and zenful as possible (both in code & UI).

## üì± Demo

**Coming Soon**
<!-- Include screenshots, gifs, or a link to a video demo here -->

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

This app is not currently available on the app store (Maybe one day it will be). If you would like to download and install this app on your phone, I recommend using an online guide on installing flutter apps for your specific platform(IOS/Android).

You'll need to have Flutter installed on your machine. For more details on setting up Flutter, visit [Flutter's official documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
