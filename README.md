# Time Since  App

Welcome to the **Time Since App**! This application allows users to track the time elapsed since a specific start date.  
I created this app as a way to gain more hands one experience with mobile app development as well as declarative UI/UX design.  
The app is meant to be as simple, elegant, and zenful as possible (both in code & UI).

## üì± Demo

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

This app is not currently available on the app store (Maybe one day it will be). If you would like to download and install this app on your phone, I recommend using an online guide on installing flutter apps for your specific platform(IOS/Android).

You'll need to have Flutter installed on your machine. For more details on setting up Flutter, visit [Flutter's official documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- [x] Basic app functionality
- [X] Enhance UI of list displays
- [X] Add ability to display times in different units
- [ ] Add home and lockscreen widgets (Doesn't seem possible for the time being due to a bug with flutter and Xcode build)[[issue#128739]](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/128739)
- [ ] Add Unit and Integration tests
- [ ] User settings to allow customization of background/other settings
- [ ] Add support for multiple goal tracking
- [ ] Dark and Light theme support (Formalize theme setup in the app)
